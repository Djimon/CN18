Problem 8.3: Sliding Window - Retransmission Strategies
List and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the three retransmission strategies introduced in the lecture.

Pipelining and Go-back-N
	+ the sender can send many frames at a time
	+ the sender can be set for a group of frames
	+ one ACK can acknowledge more than one frame
	+ higher efficiency
	- requires buffer
	- transmitter needs to store the last N packets
	- scheme is inefficient when there is a large delay &  ahigh data transmission rate
	- unnecessary retransmission of many error-free packets

Pipelining and Selective Repeat
	+ fewer retransmissions compared to Go-back-N
	+ better performance 
	+ receiver re-achnowledges already received packets with certain sequence numbers below the current window case, if the receiver does not do so, then the sender's window would not move forward 
	- more complexity at sender and receiver
	- each frame must be acknowledged individually
		=> no cumulative acknowledgements
	- receiver may receive frames out of sequence 

Pipelining and Selective Reject (also: Selective Retransmission)
	+ minimizes the amount of retransmission
	- receiver is more complex
		=> must maintain a buffer that is big enough to save post-SREJ frames until frame in error is retransmitted
		=> Extra logic for reinserting retransmitted frame in proper sequence
	- sender is more complex
		=> extra logic for sending a frame out of sequence
