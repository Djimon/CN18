Problem 1.1: ping and traceroute
i) 	First, measure the round-trip times using ping. Figure out in which countries these computers reside, too. 

	uni-muenster.de
		location: Germany
		round-trip time: ~10 ms (+- 0.5)
	mit.edu
		location: Netherlands
		round-trip time: ~20 ms (+- 5)
	cam.ac.uk
		location: United Kingdom
		round-trip time: 35-40 ms	
	istanbul.edu.tr
		location: Turkey
		round-trip time: turkey doesn't like ping, didn't work :(
		49 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 49152ms

	nsccwx.cn
		location: China
		round-trip time: ~300-400 ms
	ethz.ch
		location: Switzerland
		round-trip time: Switzerland is a bitch.
		45 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 45032ms

	uct.ac.za
		location: South Africa
		round-trip time: Nope.
		33 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 32759ms
	spbu.ru
		location: Russia
		round-trip time: ~45 ms
	uq.edu.au
		location: Australia
		round-trip time: ~300-400 ms
	www.uh.cu
		location: Cuba
		round-trip time: ~170-250ms

ii) Which of these computers have most latency? Which one has the smallest?

	Smalles latency: Obviously uni-muenster.de
	Highest latency: nsccwx.cn | uq.edu.au

iii)	One reason for latency is the limited speed of light. The speed of light depends on the medium. For example, in optical fibre it is around 230,000,000 m/s. How long does it take to tracel once around the Equator at this speed?

	40,000km = 40,000,000m
	40,000,000 / 230,000,000
	= 0.17391304347s
	//That's pretty fast tho.

iv) 	Find out how long (in number of "hops") the paths are to these computers with traceroute.
	uni-muenster.de: 6?
	mit.edu: 6?
	cam.ac.uk: 18
	istanbul.edu.tr: 9?
	nsccwx.cn: 18?
	ethz.ch: 12?
	uct.ac.za: 16?
	spbu.ru: 11
	uq.edu.au: 25?
	www.uh.cu: 13?

	//? bc * * * stuff, unclear af.

Problem 1.2: Communication Principles
Explain the differences of unicast, multicast, anycast and broadcast transmissions. Give an example application for each transmissions type. Do you know what a geocast is?

	Unicast:
	Two communication peers communicate over a Point-to-Point connection

	Multicast:
	One sender communicates to several receivers, which are known.

	Broadcast: 
	One sender transmits to all other peers. 
	Typically the other peers are (partially) unknown.

	Anycast:
	One sender transmits to a group of other peers.

	Geocast:
	Special form of multicast, one sender transmits to several receivers within a specific location.
	Uses coordinates in WGS84 as used in, for example, GPS.
